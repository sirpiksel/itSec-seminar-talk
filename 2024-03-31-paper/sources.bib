  abstract = {Our main result is a reduction from worst-case lattice problems such as GapSVP and SIVP to a certain learning problem. This learning problem is a natural extension of the “learning from parity with error” problem to higher moduli. It can also be viewed as the problem of decoding from a random linear code. This, we believe, gives a strong indication that these problems are hard. Our reduction, however, is quantum. Hence, an efficient solution to the learning problem implies a quantum algorithm for GapSVP and SIVP. A main open question is whether this reduction can be made classical (i.e., nonquantum).We also present a (classical) public-key cryptosystem whose security is based on the hardness of the learning problem. By the main result, its security is also based on the worst-case quantum hardness of GapSVP and SIVP. The new cryptosystem is much more efficient than previous lattice-based cryptosystems: the public key is of size \~{O}(n2) and encrypting a message increases its size by a factor of \~{O}(n) (in previous cryptosystems these values are \~{O}(n4) and \~{O}(n2), respectively). In fact, under the assumption that all parties share a random bit string of length \~{O}(n2), the size of the public key can be reduced to \~{O}(n).},

  abstract = { The Lenstra–Lenstra–Lovász lattice basis reduction algorithm (called LLL or \${\rm L}^3\$) is a fundamental tool in computational number theory and theoretical computer science, which can be viewed as an efficient algorithmic version of Hermite's inequality on Hermite's constant. Given an integer d-dimensional lattice basis with vectors of Euclidean norm less than B in an n-dimensional space, the \${\rm L}^3\$ algorithm outputs a reduced basis in \$O(d^3n\,{\rm log}\,B\cdot\mathcal{M}(d\,{\rm log}\,B))\$ bit operations, where \$\mathcal{M}(k)\$ denotes the time required to multiply k-bit integers. This worst-case complexity is problematic for applications where d or/and \${\rm log}\,B\$ are often large. As a result, the original \${\rm L}^3\$ algorithm is almost never used in practice, except in tiny dimension. Instead, one applies floating-point variants where the long-integer arithmetic required by Gram–Schmidt orthogonalization is replaced by floating-point arithmetic. Unfortunately, this is known to be unstable in the worst case: the usual floating-point \${\rm L}^3\$ algorithm is not even guaranteed to terminate, and the output basis may not be \${\rm L}^3\$-reduced at all. In this article, we introduce the \${\rm L}^2\$ algorithm, a new and natural floating-point variant of the \${\rm L}^3\$ algorithm which provably outputs \${\rm L}^3\$-reduced bases in polynomial time \$O(d^2n(d+{\rm log}\,B)\,{\rm log}\,B\cdot\mathcal{M}(d))\$. This is the first \${\rm L}^3\$ algorithm whose running time (without fast integer arithmetic) provably grows only quadratically with respect to \${\rm log}\,B\$, like Euclid's gcd algorithm and Lagrange's two-dimensional algorithm. }

  abstract = {The “learning with errors” (LWE) problem is to distinguish random linear equations, which have been perturbed by a small amount of noise, from truly uniform ones. The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).We resolve this question in the affirmative by introducing an algebraic variant of LWE called ring-LWE, and proving that it too enjoys very strong hardness guarantees. Specifically, we show that the ring-LWE distribution is pseudorandom, assuming that worst-case problems on ideal lattices are hard for polynomial-time quantum algorithms. Applications include the first truly practical lattice-based public-key cryptosystem with an efficient security reduction; moreover, many of the other applications of LWE can be made much more efficient through the use of ring-LWE.},
